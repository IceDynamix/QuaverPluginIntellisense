# QuaverPluginIntellisense

One of the many gripes that plugin making currently has is that there is no
autocomplete for editors, so you always have to look up the functions you have
and/or the parameters.

This is the remedy to that problem. Just chuck the `intellisense.lua` into
whatever workspace you're working in, your intelligent editor (VSCode with the
`sumneko.lua` extension for me) should pick up the registered types and give
them to you.
